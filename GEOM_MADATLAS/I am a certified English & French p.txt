I am a certified English & French professor, and I love teaching both languages to my students. I have a passion for linguistics and literature, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and enthusiasm with learners of all levels. Whether you want to improve your communication skills, prepare for an exam, or explore a new culture, I can help you achieve your goals and have fun along the way. I use a variety of methods and materials to suit different learning styles and preferences, and I always make sure to create a positive and supportive environment in my classes.
