ONLINE PRICING STRATEGY

We are a marketing firm specializing in the analysis of pricing strategies employed by various prominent online retailers. We are actively seeking a skilled individual to join our team in the role of an Online Retail Pricing Analyst.

The primary responsibility associated with this role will involve the preparation of a spreadsheet that compares the prices for various products on a specific website. The selected candidate will be tasked with the identification of products within a designated category and price range on a provided online store and will carry out tasks related to price computation.

One practical scenario for this role involves comparing prices of reselling platforms. The candidate will be required to locate a particular item, assess its resale value on a given reselling platform, and subsequently calculate the return on investment (ROI), recording these findings in the spreadsheet. The outcome will be a comprehensive list of items that exhibit the highest and lowest ROI when purchased from store A and resold on store B, among other permutations.

Our ideal candidate will possess exceptional attention to detail, a high degree of proficiency in working with data with precision, and adeptness in utilizing spreadsheet software. Furthermore, the ability to work independently is highly valued.

If you find this position intriguing and align with its requirements, please submit your application along with your contact details and availability. Prior experience in pricing analysis or data analysis is advantageous but not mandatory. We eagerly anticipate receiving your application and exploring the potential for you to join our team!
